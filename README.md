> **Paper:** *Enhancing Social-Aware Autonomous Navigation Scheme with LiDAR and RGB Sensor Fusion*  

This repository hosts the code, simulation assets, and supplementary material for the **ESF** model—an early-fusion pipeline that projects 2-D LiDAR points onto RGB frames, filters them with YOLOv8 detections, and feeds the fused features into an RNN-Transformer stack for real-time decision-making.  
Compared with DR-SPAAM, ESF cuts inference time by **≈ 48 %** while doubling the frame rate, with comparable recall and F1-score
